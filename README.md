# Image-TextSteganography
##	Project Description:
An image steganography by converting the image into text of pixels and use the LSB to hide the ciphered text that encrypted by The Caesar cipher Algorithm (Cryptography). The project decrypt the image by loading it, converting the pixelsâ€™ digits and break the LSB.
##	Language:
-	C#: converting from image to text and vice versa.
-	Assembly x86:  Encryption and Decryption (Steganography).
-	Assembly x86: Encryption and Decryption (Cryptography).
-	Assembly x86: Linking between Assembly code and C#.


## To contribute:
1. [ ] replace the caesar cipher by a strong cipher algorithm.
1. [ ] add more features.
